<div class="w3-container">
 
<p>I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Puerto Rico in Bayam√≥n,
	studying a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.I like to help other people,
	especially in the field of technology that there is still a large sector that 
	does not dominate it. I like to think how I could help improve my environment 
	with the use of technology. I've volunteered at camps like Compuchi@s 2022 just 
	to help someone else find a passion for programming.

<p> 
	So far in my university career I have worked on two projects.
The first was called People Care, and it was an ideas contest
to help different sectors of Puerto Rico with covid. This project,
although it cost me and my team a lot of work, it was very important
in my career as it was a very important basis for my next MEDIC ID project.
In this university project my role was as group leader having to supervise each part of it. Medic Id a complete and functional project!!
